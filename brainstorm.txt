<Write app which allows editing of a scripting language with voyages that show animated backgrounds with instructions which use the user
as a coprocessor>
<Program is a tree which can be extended by splitting nodes into subactions>
<Voyages can be created and stopped at any time, each voyage has its own state>
<Voyages can record screenshots for timelapses>

<Use the app model and the following prototype scripting options to build the app>

Write an app system which takes sudo code which
can prompt the user for actions, record input,
and display combinations of input. Basically a language
which the user programs to get their future self to
do something.

<Use this app to write a story using the following as a gimicke>

tell a story
shift the scenes in the story forward 1 third wrapping around
3/3 => 1/3 => 2/3
layer plot points across the wrap boundary
write a story line
shift time 1/nth of the way forward wrapping around
add a story line
etc
until all lines written

What if I wrote a book using this technique.
